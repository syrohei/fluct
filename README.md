# Fluct
Fluct is a framework to build server-less web applications using
[Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).
This stack brings about great advantages in the web development,
such as fully isolated components, infinitely scalability, easy and rapid development,
cheap server cost, and more and more.

## Getting Started
### 1. Install
Install `fluct` executable via npm.

```
$ npm install fluct -g
```

### 2. Create an application
Create a new application with an application name.

```
$ fluct new myapp
Created ./myapp
Created ./myapp/.gitignore
Created ./myapp/actions
Created ./myapp/actions/.keep
Created ./myapp/package.json
```

### 3. Create an action
Enter the application folder and generate a new action.

```
$ cd myapp
$ fluct generate list_users
Created ./actions/list_users
Created ./actions/list_users/index.js
Created ./actions/list_users/package.json
```

### 4. Set up the action
Update the action's package.json with proper httpMethod and path.

```
$ vi actions/list_users/package.json
$ cat actions/list_users/package.json
{
  "name": "list_users",
  "private": true,
  "fluct": {
    "contentType": "text/html",
    "httpMethod": "GET",
    "path": "/users",
    "statusCode": 200
  }
}
```

### 5. Set up the package.json
Head over to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and create a new IAM role
that has `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`, then set its role name and your account ID
to application's package.json (Account ID is written in integers in user's ARN).
This role is used to allow API Gateway to invoke Lambda functions.

```
$ vi package.json
$ cat package.json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "private": true,
  "fluct": {
    "accountId": "012345678912",
    "restapiId": null,
    "roleName": "fluct-example-role"
    "region":"us-west-2",
    "stageName":"production"
  }
}
```

### 6. Deploy it
Deploy your application to Lambda and API Gateway.

```
$ fluct deploy
Created zip file: ./actions/list_users/lambda.zip
Uploaded function: list_users
Updated endpoint: GET /users
Deployed: https://123ge4oabj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production
```

### 7. Done!
Try to send HTTP requests to your endpoints.

```
$ curl https://123ge4oabj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/users -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
